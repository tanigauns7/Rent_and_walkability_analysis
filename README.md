# Rent_and_walkability_analysis
This research project investigated the causal relationship between neighborhood walkability and rental prices using data from over 220,000 US block groups. By integrating EPA's National Walkability Index with Census rental data and crime statistics from 23+ major cities, I developed econometric models to quantify how walkability affects housing costs. The analysis revealed a statistically significant 1.1% increase in median rent for each standard deviation increase in walkability. The project employed advanced statistical techniques including OLS regression with county fixed effects, LASSO feature selection, and interaction models to control for confounding variables like demographics, commute patterns, and crime rates. This work contributes to urban planning research by providing empirical evidence of walkability's economic value in American housing markets.
