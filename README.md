About the Project
The Effect of Walkability on Rent
This econometric research project examined whether neighborhood walkability influences rental prices across the United States. Using EPA's 2019 National Walkability Index covering 220,427 block groups nationwide, we integrated Census rental data and crime statistics from 22 major cities to build comprehensive statistical models. The analysis employed OLS regression with county fixed effects and controlled for demographic factors, commute patterns, and property characteristics to isolate the causal impact of walkability on housing costs.
The study found a statistically significant 1.1% increase in median rent for each standard deviation increase in walkability, translating to approximately 5% total effect across the full walkability range. We also investigated how crime rates moderate this relationship, though interaction effects were not statistically significant. The research addresses growing interest in walkable urban development and provides empirical evidence of walkability's economic value in American housing markets, contributing to ongoing debates about sustainable city planning and transportation policy.
